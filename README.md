# NewsNexusRequesterGoogleNewsRss03

## Overview

The Google News RSS requester process is broken into two main parts:

- base url: https://news.google.com/rss/
- This NewsNexusRequesterGoogleNewsRss03 is different from NewsNexusRequesterGoogleNewsRss02 in that it uses the NewsNexusDb09 database.

### 1. Creating Prioritized Request Parameter Array

The app reads search parameter combinations from an Excel spreadsheet located at the path defined by the `PATH_AND_FILENAME_FOR_QUERY_SPREADSHEET_AUTOMATED` environment variable. Each parameter object contains `andString`, `orString`, and `notString` fields.

These parameter objects are then prioritized using the following logic:

- Parameters that have **never been requested** before (i.e. no matching entry in the `NewsApiRequests` table) are placed **first**.
- Parameters that have been requested previously are then sorted in **ascending order of their `dateEndOfRequest`**, so older requests are retried first.

### 2. Making News API Requests

Once the prioritized array is constructed, the application:

- Iterates through the request parameter array.
- Makes a News API request for each item.
- Updates the `NewsApiRequests` table with the results, including the `dateEndOfRequest`, ensuring accurate tracking of each parameter's request history.

This methodical approach ensures comprehensive and prioritized coverage of query terms, avoiding redundant or excessive API usage.

## Requirements

This app requires importing or adding the `newsnexusdb09` package, which provides the Sequelize setup and model definitions needed to read and write to the `NewsApiRequests` table.
